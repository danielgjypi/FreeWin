# FreeWin (currently not supported)
Run the "activate.exe" file as an administrator and go through the activation process.
If you are not sure what version of windows you're running, Click on the Start Button -> Type "This Pc" -> Click on properties -> Look for Windows 10 (windows edition), or type "C" on the main page of the app.

# FreeOffice (Experimental)
Run the "activate.exe" file as an administrator, and press "O" to start the activation process. It should be automatic. It currently only works for Office 2016.
# Windows edition codes
When asked to type your Windows 10 Edition, follow the steps below:
On the left is the name of the edition and on the right is the keycode
(edition) - (keycode)
* Windows 10 Pro - pro
* Windows 10 Pro N - pron
* Windows 10 Home - home
* Windows 10 Home N - homen
* Windows 10 Home Single Language - homes
* Windows 10 Home Country Specific - homecs
* Windows 10 Education - edu
* Windows 10 Education N - edun
* Windows 10 Enterprise - ent
* Windows 10 Enterprise N - entn
# FreeWin GUI (Coming Soon)
I'll upload an executable file of how the GUI version of FreeWin will look when I have more time. Until then, use the console version.
